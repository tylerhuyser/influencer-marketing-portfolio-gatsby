[KILZ](https://amzn.to/4iz7LKd) sought to better educate customers on how to get the most out of their various home improvement products. Partnering with PureWow, our team crafted a mini-content series to help achieve this goal.

The video series was composed of short "how-to" videos, showcasing unconventional uses for their paint & wood finishing products.

To enhance these videos, we cast interior design-savvy influencer talent to help guide viewers throughout the various steps of the tutorial.

Furthermore, we leveraged these influencers' handles in order to extend the content's reach amongst a home improvement & DIY-obsessed audience.
