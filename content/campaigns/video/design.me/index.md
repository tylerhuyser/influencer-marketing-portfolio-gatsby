Being a relatively young brand, Design.Me sought to increase awareness of their haircare products.

Partnering with Blink Beauty, we devised a content mini-series cataloging hair tutorials using Design.Me products.

To expand the reach of these videos, we cast influencers to guide viewers through the various steps of the tutorial. The final videos were then posted to these influencers' handles, garnering an extra 20,000 impressions of added value for the client.
