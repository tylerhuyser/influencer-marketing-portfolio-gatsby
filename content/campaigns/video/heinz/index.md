While mayonnaise might be one of the most recognizable condiments in the world, Heinz sought to increase consumer awareness of some outside-the-box uses for the condiment.

Producing a Top Chef-inspired mini-series, we enlisted the help of three chef influencers to develop a total of five (5) original recipes for the show.

While the videos aired on PureWow's digital & social channels, the influencer extension of the program generated an additional 75,000 impressions as added value.
