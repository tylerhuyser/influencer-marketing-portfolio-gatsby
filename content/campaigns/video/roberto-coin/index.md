While their line of handcrafted jewelry features endless timeless pieces, Roberto Coin sought to better communicate their legacy within the modern context.

In order to achieve this goal, we devised a simple tutorial-style video, showcasing the various ways to style Roberto Coin pieces in everyday life: from the office to date night.

To showcase these various looks, we enlisted the help of NYC fashion influencer, Maggie Tate. Furthermore, Maggie helped extend the reach of the collaboration by sharing the content with her audience as well.
