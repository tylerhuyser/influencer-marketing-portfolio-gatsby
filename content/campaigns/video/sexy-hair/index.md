Following the release of their [Texture series](https://amzn.to/48wq51Q) of professional haircare products, Sexy Hair sought to increase consumer awareness of the products' ability to create the perfect beach-y look.

Partnering with Blink Beauty, our team created a mini-tutorial series, starring lifestyle & beauty influencers in order to showcase the magic that Sexy Hair can create.

The scope of the collaboration only required syndication of the content on the @BlinkBeauty Instagram handle. However, we optimized the collaboration by contracting the influencers to post on their channels as well, thereby expanding the reach of each tutorial.
