As 2018 drew to a close, Ulta Beauty sought creative ways to highlight the various products featured in their three biggest promotions of the year: 21 Days of Beauty, Good Hair Day, and Ulta Holiday.

Leveraging the beauty-centric @BlinkBeauty platform, we developed a content series in order to highlight various items featured in the promotions. Videos fell under one of two formats: tutorials or bag spills.

To star in these videos we assembled an array of beauty & lifestyle influencers. Beyond syndication on @BlinkBeauty, these influencers gave the promotion further exposure by posting the final video on their handles as well.
