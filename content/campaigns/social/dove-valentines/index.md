While Valentine's Day is a celebration of love for some, for others it is holiday better left forgotten. This year, Dove wanted to flip the script and celebrate singlehood.

Assembling a diverse group of influencers, we created a campaign that encouraged single customers to treat themselves this Valentine's day with a nice dinner, a bouquet of flowers, and a bag of Dove chocolates.
