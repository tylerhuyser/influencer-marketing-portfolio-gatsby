Following the release of their new City Shield skincare line of products, Neutrogena sought raise consumer awareness of the products' wide array of benefits.

Partnering with Blink Beauty, we selected a diverse array on influencers, from various regions of the United States, to explain how Neutrogena City Shield helps combat the pollutants in their area.

Beyond syndication on the influencer's handles, content was featured in a user-generated-content (UGC) round-up on Blink Beauty's web & social properties.
