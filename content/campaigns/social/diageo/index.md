Multinational spirits distributor, Diageo, sought to inspire a sales lift for all the brands in its portfolio.

Working with VaynerMedia, they created a campaign entitled Top 100 Cocktails. Beginning in Spring, a new cocktail would be revealed each day, ending just in time for the festivities that arrive with Summer.

To expand the impact of this effort, our team assembled a cohort of influencers to create their favorite cocktail from the Top 100 Cocktails list. Posting one (1) post and one (1) story, influencers generated over 300,000 organic impressions for the brand.
