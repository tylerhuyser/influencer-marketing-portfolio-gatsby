Leading consumer goods corporation, Procter & Gamble, sought to build recognition for their new line of eco-friendly home cleaners, 9 Elements. The Gallery Media Group team partnered with P&G in order to build an influencer program that would introduce 9 Elements to the market.

Assembling a diverse group of female influencers, ranging from outdoors enthusiasts to stay-at-home mothers to fitness freaks, the messaging of the campaign reinforced the universality of the brand's core value: less is more.

Optimized with trackable "Swipe Up" links and unique coupon codes, influencers drove traffic to the 9 Elements digital store, generating over 1,250 unique visits throughout the partnership.
