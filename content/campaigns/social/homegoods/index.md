Oftentimes when one utters the name "HomeGoods," memories of treasure hunting come to mind. However, despite common knowledge, HomeGoods offers plenty of items suitable for use outside the home as well.

Seeking to bring attention to their patio and backyard inventory, we assembled a diverse array of decorating-savvy influencers. Inspired by the "treasure hunt" experience, influencers were tasked with showcasing their in-store "haul" as well as the final, stylized look outside their home.

All in all, the campaign resonated with the influencers' audiences, generating a whopping 1,000,000+ impressions.
