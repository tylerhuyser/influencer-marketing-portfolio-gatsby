Everyone knows with the change of seasons comes two things: a change in weather and new inventory at JustFab.com.

In order to help drive awareness towards the new arrivals, we assembled a diverse array of fashion influencers to style their favorite looks from the JustFab's Fall 2018 collection.

Sporting fur coats and warm booties, the JustFab influencer program generated over 500 unique visits to their online store. Furthermore, the content created from the program was up-cycled and given syndication on the @JustFabOnline handle.
