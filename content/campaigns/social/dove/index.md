Chocolatier, Dove, sought to increase consumer awareness of the multitude of use for their iconic heart-shaped chocolates (beyond the needed moment of indulgence, of course).

As such, Dove partnered with PureWow to build an influencer program that would showcase Dove chocolates being used in other ways. Our team assembled a small group of baking-savvy influencers to develop original recipes & videos featuring Dove chocolates.

The results were tantalizing, amounting in over 150,000 organic impressions, over 5,000 engagements, and a few empty bags of Dove chocolates lying around the office (to say the least).
