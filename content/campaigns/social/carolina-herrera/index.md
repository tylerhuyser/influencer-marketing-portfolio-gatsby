With the release of Good Girl Légère EDP, Carolina Herrera sought to raise awareness of the reformulated product's evolution from the original (and iconic) Good Girl fragrance.

Partnering with PureWow, our team created an influencer program that leveraged a diverse array of lifestyle influencers in order to give the product a comprehensive introduction to the market.

The ask? To create video or .gif content that embodies the duality at the core of Good Girl Légère EDP: it's good to be bad.

The result: over 250,000 organic impressions and twenty-five pieces of original content licensed for use on Carolina Herrera's web & social properties.
