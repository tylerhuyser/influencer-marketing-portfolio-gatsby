Owning a suit is a man's right of passage. It usually enters a man’s wardrobe around high school prom and doesn’t get an upgrade until his wedding day. But a well-fitting suit should be a closet’s anchoring staple.

Calvin Klein sought to better communicate the comfort and versatility of their classic suits amongst the Gen Z male. Partnering with ONE37pm, our team built an influencer program that could achieve this goal.

Identifying athletes to be an efficient channel through which to communicate this value proposition, we assembled a cohort of ten up-and-coming athletes (Rising Tier). The task: to illustrate how Calvin Klein helps assist their "style evolution" on and off the court.

Furthermore, to enhance the campaign, we featured three three celebrity athletes (Dennis Smith Jr., Miguel Andujar, and Paul Rabil) in a three-part editorial series showcasing the various ways to style a Calvin Klein suit for any occasion.
