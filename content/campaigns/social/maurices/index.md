Being a women's fashion retailer, maurices sought to better connect with their customers on social. However, with all of their 1,000+ locations being located in the Midwest, they wanted to ensure that their brand message would mostly be received by women who actually lived within the maurices footprint.

Using a proprietary tool, we located fashion influencers based in the Midwest whose audiences majorly resided in the Midwest.

To complement the activation, we featured influencer content in a round-up on PureWow.com. Furthermore, we circulated the round-up in an e-mail targeted towards Midwestern subscribers.
