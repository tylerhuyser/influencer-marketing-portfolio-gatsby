Amazon Studios wanted to increase consumer awareness of its latest release, the drama, "Life Itself".

Partnering with PureWow for the collaboration, our team sought to assemble a cohort of influencers who would relate to the film's central theme: the uncertainty of life and the power of love.

Gathering a roster of mommy-influencers, we created a campaign that generated an engagement rate that over-indexed benchmarks by over three (3) points.
