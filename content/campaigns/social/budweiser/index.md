With a rich history, over 143 years in the making, Budweiser sought to reach and resonate with a new generation of beer lovers.

The brand enlisted the help of Gallery Media Group to build an influencer program composed of distinguished creators that would imbue a new visual narrative alongside the iconic Budweiser brand. Areas of focus included photography, skateboarding, music, hip-hop, and streetwear.

Content was posted on these creator's Instagram handles, giving Budweiser the opportunity to introduce their brand to these emerging subcultures.

Furthermore, through strategic licensing agreements, Budweiser was able to populate the content on the @BudweiserUSA handle, thereby giving the brand a refresh that lasts beyond the boundaries of the partnership.
