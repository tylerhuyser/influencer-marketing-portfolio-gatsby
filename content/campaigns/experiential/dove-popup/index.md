Dove sought to remove the stigma surrounding seeking pleasure. After all, why not treat yo' self? Partnering with PureWow, Dove threw a multi-sensorial event that celebrated what life is all about: indulgence.

To compliment the event, our team invited a select group of influencers to share the Dove #PleasureSeeker experience with their followers, generating over 250,000 organic impressions as added value.
