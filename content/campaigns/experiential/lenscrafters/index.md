In May 2019, LensCrafters x PureWow invited women in NYC for an intimate conversation with Bobbi Brown discussing seeing clearly, self-care, and living your best life during the upcoming spring/summer season.

In order to expand the footprint of the event to include those not located in the NYC-area, we invited a select group of influencer to spread Bobbi's impactful message through a combination of Instagram posts and stories.
