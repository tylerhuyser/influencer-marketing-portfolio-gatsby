In mid-August, PureWow sought to celebrate their one-to-one influencer network, The Coterie. Furthermore, they sought to leverage the occasion as an opportunity to bring value to some of their most committed partners.

The stylish crowd mingled around the pool while sipping Bailey’s Banana Coladas and other cocktails (courtesy of Don Julio and Ketel One Botanicals) and staying hydrated with Spindrift sparkling water. Guests treated themselves to hand massages and hair touch-ups at the PureWow Beauty Lounge, stocked with products from Olay, Herbal Essences, Head & Shoulders and Pantene. And after a day of sun, rosé and many an Instagram opportunity, everyone left with a swag bag from CALIA by Carrie Underwood, complete with enough workout gear to last an entire year.

Take a peek at the best moments from the festivities below.
