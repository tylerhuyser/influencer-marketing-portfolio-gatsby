Following the viral success of musical-commercial "I Can't Wait to Wash My Face", Olay set their eyes on new musical heights: Broadway (yes, Broadway!)

Producing a forty-five minute show, entitled "The Road to Glow," Olay made its Broadway debut on April 9th--for one night only!

In order to maximize the show's impact, we stuffed the seats of New Worlds Stage with as many influencers as possible. Of course, written into the script were numerous shameless reminders, encouraging audience members to whip out their phones and post as much as possible.

Check out the highlights below!
