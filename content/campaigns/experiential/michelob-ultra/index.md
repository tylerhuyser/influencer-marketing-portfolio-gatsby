With athleisure outfits, green juice smoothies, and high-intensity workouts becoming the norm, Michelob Ultra sought to remind fitness freaks that their 95-calorie beer can inject some fun into an active lifestyle.

Pinpointing Miami as a market ripe with opportunity, we devised an activation featuring blowouts, a 45-minute VIXEN workout, and, of course, complementary Michelob Ultra beers.

We invited influencers from local to the Miami area to populate the event. Through their live posts and stories followers at home were able to enjoy the Michelob experience as well.
